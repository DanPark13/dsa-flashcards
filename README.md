# Web Development Project 3 - *FlashDSA*

Submitted by: **Daniel Park**

This web app: **FlashDSA** is your ultimate study companion tailored for those aspiring to ace LeetCode-style technical interviews. With a repository of carefully curated flashcards, it breaks down the intricacies of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to digestible bits, helping candidates internalize the core concepts, strategies, and nuances vital for solving coding challenges. **FlashDSA's** cards cover arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, dynamic programming, and other pivotal DSA topics.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Notes

A lot of the features I implemented as stretches in last week's assignment. I will also probably remove the guess answer feature or have it on the other side of the card to guess the short answer and not the entire description
