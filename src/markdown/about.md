# About This Site

Welcome to the **DSA Cards!**, a practice resources designed to strengthen your knowledge and fill in knowledge gaps as you prepare for interviews through spaced repetition.

The concept behind spaced repetition is simple yet remarkably effective: instead of studying information all at once and then forgetting it over time, spaced repetition involves reviewing the material at increasing intervals, allowing you to reinforce your memory more effectively. Many future doctors use [flashcards and spaced reptition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2StK7e3ww&ab_channel=MedSchoolInsiders) to memorize the thousands of facts within their multiple classes and for their standardized tests such as the MCAT and USMLEs.

So if medical students use flashcards (such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)) for remembering everything for their classes, why can't we as software engineers use it for our standardized test: the dreaded coding exam?

## How to Use This Site

Upon opening the cards (clicking on **Home** on the topbar), you'll be greeted with the main screen featuring several intuitive buttons to help you navigate through the app effortlessly, allowing you to review each card at your own pace. 

You can press the card which allows you to toggle between the question and answer sides of the flashcard, enabling you to test your knowledge effectively. Select **New Card** to reveal the new card. Use the **Previous** button to return to the previous card you looked at and use the **Forwards** button to move forward when you moved back in the deck with **Previous**

The **Shuffle** button randomizes the order of the flashcards, providing a fresh learning experience each time. Finally, the "Reset" button clears your progress and returns you to the beginning of the flashcard deck, ideal for starting a new study session. With these intuitive buttons at your fingertips, mastering new concepts and reinforcing your knowledge has never been easier.

## Why Python?

Python is a popular choice for coding interviews due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Its clear and concise syntax allows programmers to express complex ideas with fewer lines of code, making it easier to understand and debug. Python's extensive standard library provides built-in functions and modules for common tasks, saving time and effort in coding solutions. 

While in competitive programming you may want to use C++ due to Python's slow runtime, in most cases in code interviews, Python's dynamic typing and high-level data structures simplify problem-solving, allowing programmers to focus more on the logic of their algorithms rather than low-level implementation details which may be handy for competitive. Its ease of use makes Python an excellent choice for quickly prototyping solutions during coding interviews, enabling candidates to showcase their problem-solving skills effectively.
