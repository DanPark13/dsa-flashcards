# Useful Resources

The purpose of DSA Cards is meant to reinforce or fill in the gaps of your knowledge on Data Structures & Algorithms. Here are other resources you can use in different stages of learning depending on whether you're a beginner all the way to applying these concepts into practice.

## I'm Not Sure What to Practice...

Go through the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice), which is an extended version of the famed [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) list.

Even if you don't have the best, full understanding of DSA, I suggest you go through the list and start solving problems as you'll pick up a lot of the data structures and patterns needed for interviews through solving problems.

These were the resources I have used when studying for DSA Interviews. If you have any other suggestions for great resources to use when studying, feel free to drop in a [pull request](https://github.com/DanPark13/dsa-flashcards/pulls) with a resource you genuinely believe would be useful for learning / practicing!
