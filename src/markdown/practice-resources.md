# Useful Resources

The purpose of DSA Cards is meant to reinforce or fill in the gaps of your knowledge on Data Structures & Algorithms. Here are other resources you can use in different stages of learning depending on whether you're a beginner all the way to applying these concepts into practice.

## I Don't Know How to Code (Python)

Before you tackle interview questions, it is recommended that you know the Python basics. I personally recommend the [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book by Al Sweigart. It is a book designed for learning Python for anyone who uses a computer to learn how to code small, practical programs to automate tasks on their computer.

## I Don't Know Any Data Structures...

As long as you have the basics, you should have no problem going ahead and start tackling LeetCode questions, but if you wish a lecture-style class for learning algorithms for coding interviews, I personally recommend either [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) from Princeton University or [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) from ThePrimeagen.

## I'm Not Sure What to Practice...

Go through the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice), which is an extended version of the famed [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) list.

Even if you don't have the best, full understanding of DSA, I suggest you go through the list and start solving problems as you'll pick up a lot of the data structures and patterns needed for interviews through solving problems.

These were the resources I have used when studying for DSA Interviews.
